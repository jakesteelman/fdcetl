# FDCETL

This is a mini ETL-ish set of notebooks that collect the USDA's FDC databases and get them into a single table I can upload into my application [Macroscanner](https://github.com/jakesteelman/macroscanner).

It also attempts to calculate the densities (g/mL) of foods that have a volume measure associated with them.
